When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
(1) When collaborating
(2) To have a cloud backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
(1) Perhaps I am not ready to receive updates on my side.
(2) I need to commit and push first before pulling.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
(1) Fork - when I would like to make a copy of someone else's repository within Github
(2) Clones - when I would like to make a copy of a repository within the local computer or between the local computer and github
(3) Branches - when I would like to make a separate history to work on the master code in the repository in the local computer

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- I can know what was the change made by a collaborater so that I can merge easier with my own changes
