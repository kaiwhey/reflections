When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
(1) When collaborating
(2) To have a cloud backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
(1) Perhaps I am not ready to receive updates on my side.
(2) I need to commit and push first before pulling.
