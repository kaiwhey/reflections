What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It createds a .git file that will keep commits for version control.
Version control can only start after a repository is initialized.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area holds the files to commit as a single unit.
So we can group files within the repository and working directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change
Controlling what files with changes are placed in the staging area I can make sure that commits are controlled
